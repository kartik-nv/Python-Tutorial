1. Write a while loop that starts at the last character in the
string and works its way backwards to the first character in the string,
printing each letter on a separate line, except backwards.

2. Write a program that takes full name of a person as input and prints only
the letter present at even-th position.

3. Make changes to the 2nd program such that it prints the
letters at even-th position but in backwards.

4. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and last 2 characters of a given string. If the string length is less than 2, return the empty string instead.

5. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself. (Eg. Antartica -> Ant$rtic$)

6. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings, separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string. (Eg.  'abc', 'xyz' => 'xyc abz')

7. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing', add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged. (Test for work, to, relating)

8. Write a python program to check if a character in a string (word) occurs more than once, and if yes, remove each occurence of such characters from the word. (Eg. 'Mississippi' -> 'M')

9. Write a Python program to change a given string to a newly string where the first and last chars have been exchanged. (Coding => godinC)

10. Parse the following lines using slicing techniques and from each line record 2 things.
a) The company of the mail address (after @)
b) The entire Day and Date after the mail id

The lines are:

You can iterate via each string and parse it and print it then and there.

11. Write a Python program to check if a string is palindrome or not.
